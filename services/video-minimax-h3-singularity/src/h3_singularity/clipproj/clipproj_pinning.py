"""Pin a ModelPatcher so ComfyUI cannot move its weights.

Required whenever a model is loaded with offload_device equal to load_device.
In that configuration an unload frees nothing -- the weights are already "on" the
offload device -- yet ComfyUI removes the model from its memory accounting. It
then believes it has more VRAM than it really does and eventually OOMs.
Neutralising the unload entry points stops it from trying.

Deliberately minimal: the patcher's class is swapped for a subclass whose unload
methods do nothing. No change to ComfyUI core, and the object stays a
ModelPatcher in every other respect.
