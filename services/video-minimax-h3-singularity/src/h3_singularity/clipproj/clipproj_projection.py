"""Load projection matrices and build the control matrices.

A projection is a .safetensors file (or a legacy .pt) holding:

    W         [d_in, d_out]  matrix learned by ridge regression
    mean_in   [d_in]         mean activation of the small model
    std_in    [d_in]         matching standard deviation
    mean_out  [d_out]        mean activation of the large model
    std_out   [d_out]        matching standard deviation
    tap       int            which layer of the small model to read

Reconstruction: cond = ((h - mean_in) / std_in) @ W * std_out + mean_out

Optional keys (source_model, target_model, cos_test, r2_test, n_train_tokens)
are informational only.

In a .safetensors file the tensors are stored as such and every scalar goes to
the header metadata, which safetensors keeps as strings; they are converted back
on load. Prefer that format: a .pt goes through pickle, which can execute
arbitrary code when opened, whereas safetensors cannot.
